## Motivation

This repository holds the Frontend for a project called [`Proffy`](https://proffys.vercel.app/), created during [Next Level Week #2](https://nextlevelweek.com/inscricao/2). In this bootcamp, we created a platform in which teachers can promote their services and students can get in contact with them.

The Backend for this project can be found [`here`](https://github.com/vix993/BackendForProffy).

You can run it by cloning the repository. Running `npm install`, then executing the command `npm run start`.
